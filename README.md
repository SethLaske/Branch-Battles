## Game mechanics
Lead your victories as the general of an army in training. Train miners to get gold, and gold to grow your army. When the time is right send your army to fight against the enemy forces. Send your soldiers to die alone, or lead the charge and risk dying alongside your men. As you progress through the game you will gain access to different soldiers as well as being able to train a wider army variety in each battle. 
Some mechanics that might help you on your conquests:
- Stay within the limits of your camp to train units, heal your character, and do more damage
- Your units will maintain formations while rallying and charging towards the enemy
- Gain souls as your units perish, use these souls to cast spells against your opponents
